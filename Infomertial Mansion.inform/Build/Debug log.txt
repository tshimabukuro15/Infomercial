I've also read Standard Rules by Graham Nelson, which is 42616 words long.
I've also read English Language by Graham Nelson, which is 2288 words long.

    Problem PM_ChalkCheese issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1501

      >--> The sentence 'The dog treats are a key' (source text, line 13) appears
        to say two things are the same - I am reading 'dog treats' and 'key' as two
        different things, and therefore it makes no sense to say that one is the
        other: it would be like saying that 'Poirot is Hastings'. It would be all
        right if the second thing were the name of a kind, perhaps with properties:
        for instance 'St Mary Mead is a lighted room' says that something called St
        Mary Mead exists and that it is a 'room', which is a kind I know about,
        combined with a property called 'lighted' which I also know about.

    Problem PM_ObjectIsValue issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1424
    (Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the description for the chihuahua is "You cannot enter the room. A angry chihuahua fiercely guards the entrance with the ferocity of a million aztec warriors.">.)

      >--> You wrote 'The description for the chihuahua is "You cannot enter the
        room. A angry [...] ocity of a million aztec warriors."' (source text, line 17):
        but this seems to say that a thing is a value, like saying 'the chair is
        10'.

    Problem PM_ChalkCheese issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1501

      >--> The sentence 'The wig is a key' (source text, line 21) appears to say
        two things are the same - I am reading 'wig' and 'key' as two different
        things, and therefore it makes no sense to say that one is the other: it
        would be like saying that 'Poirot is Hastings'. It would be all right if
        the second thing were the name of a kind, perhaps with properties: for
        instance 'St Mary Mead is a lighted room' says that something called St
        Mary Mead exists and that it is a 'room', which is a kind I know about,
        combined with a property called 'lighted' which I also know about.

    Problem PM_ObjectIsValue issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1424
    (Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the description for the wig is "This is Marty's personal wig. He apparently uses it to control his robotic inventions like a remote.">.)

      >--> You wrote 'The description for the wig is "This is Marty's personal wig.
        He a [...] robotic inventions like a remote."' (source text, line 21):
        again, this seems to say that a thing is a value.

    Problem PM_ChalkCheese issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1501

      >--> The sentence 'The banana boat is a key' (source text, line 41) appears
        to say two things are the same - I am reading 'banana boat' and 'key' as
        two different things, and therefore it makes no sense to say that one is
        the other: it would be like saying that 'Poirot is Hastings'. It would be
        all right if the second thing were the name of a kind, perhaps with
        properties: for instance 'St Mary Mead is a lighted room' says that
        something called St Mary Mead exists and that it is a 'room', which is a
        kind I know about, combined with a property called 'lighted' which I also
        know about.
